# MHW_EVWP_Template
Binary Template for the 010 Editor to edit various weapon parameters in Monster Hunter: World.

Such as:
- Personal room weapon rack position, rotation, and scale.
- Sheathed position and rotation (scaling is done automatically apparently, probably by animation).
- Pendant position, rotation, and scale.
- Global EFX setting.
- Various bitflags (like having Ciri's dual blade dash on any dual blades)

_Thanks to Silvris for researching and creating this with me!_
